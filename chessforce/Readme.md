#### Project Description
Play chess against workers on Effect Force!

#### Summary
Both sides have a chessboard. You can submit your move by posting a new task and the workers can submit their move by completing that task on Effect Force. Both the task batches and the results contain a [FEN string](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth-Edwards_Notation) to describe the chess board positions

#### Next Steps
- Would like to see multiple repetitions so that you are not playing against one worker, but for example 10 workers (majority decides what move they will make)
- Figure out ways to prevent cheating
- Would be great if workers would get a bonus if they win
