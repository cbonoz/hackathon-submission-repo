#### Project Description
Play chess against workers on Effect Force!

#### Summary
Both sides have a chessboard. You can submit your move by posting a new task and the workers can submit their move by completing that task on Effect Force

#### URLs
List any URLs relevant to demonstrating your prototype

#### Presentation
List any links to your presentation or any related visuals you want to share.

#### Next Steps
- Would like to see multiple repetitions so that you are not playing against one worker, but for example 10 workers (majority decides what move they will make)
- Figure out ways to prevent cheating
- Would be great if workers would get a bonus if they win
