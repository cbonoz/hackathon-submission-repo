#### Project Description
The idea of Effect Voice was born is when I'm stuck in traffic jams, i'm talking to myself, getting bored and nothing to do, it's really waste of time. In my country - Malaysia, it is illegal to playing with phone while driving or even get stuck in traffic, so the only thing I can do is listen to the radio and be in a daze.

Everyday I spend at least 2 hours in traffic jams to and from the work, and did you know that according to the world traffic statistic report, people of Malaysia spend 1 hour on average in heavy traffic jams every day and the Malaysia only ranks 73rd in the world traffic congestion rankings ! I can't imagine how much time people in the rank 1st country spend every day stuck in traffic.

So I wondering if it's possible to create something meaningful for those who are stuck in traffic every day, instead of wasting time but turn these time to contribute to the community and earn extra income.

Therefore I created Effect Voice.

#### Summary
Effect Voice is an Effect Network template that allow worker to complete tasks with their voice and earn EFX rewards. Freedom to work from anywhere at anytime with your voice, even stuck in traffic jams, exercising or doing any relaxation and time consuming activity.

Main concept of Effect Voice is to replace click and touch actions with voice control while reading the content of the question to the worker. The following is a list of Effect Voice command :

- begin : to start reading the question content to the worker
- repeat : to re-read the question content
- positive : to submit with an answer of "Positive"
