#### Project Description
Effect Network has created a great platform to decentralize work and the delegation of tasks. However, the tasks that the current dapps are built for are quite trivial. This project, *Effect Notebooks* intends to expand the capabilities of the Effect Network to more involved types of work, particularly in the field of Data Science. 

#### Summary
*Effect Notebooks* works by providing users with a jupyter notebook layout for tasks. Data Science professionals can then use provided data in the jupyter notebooks to find insights in the information an display it in a way that is readable and useful
