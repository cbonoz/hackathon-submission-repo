#### Using Effect Notebooks
Effect Notebooks currently relies on 2 local servers. To run the jupyter server go to the server directory and run the command in the notes text file. To start up the local server for creating tasks you must also be in the server directory and run ```python batch_client.py``` jupyter and flask are required to run these servers.


#### Project Description
When learning about the Effect Network, I noticed that many of the use cases for Effect Force were for classifying data manually with the intent of using that data for machine learning. Having done some data science work myself, I thought about how most of the time is spent on cleaning data. If only there was a way to automate the formatting of data... Effect Network seemed like the perfect platform to implement such an idea. And with that I created Effect Notebooks.

#### Summary
Effect Notebooks is a campaign where workers can earn EFX tokens for writing code that will automate the cleaning of data, the way a task specifies. From the app side of things, you can upload a CSV and then give an example of how the data should be reformatted. Efffect Notebooks then takes this and builds a jupyter notebook file with the data preloaded for the worker. All the worker has to do is fill in the blanks of the cleanData function to earn tokens.

#### Next Steps
There is a ton of potential for more notebook based use cases outside of cleaning data. This was a proof of concept use case for the purpose of the hackathon, but there are many other ways we could improve the development environment to add more complex work to the Effect Network
