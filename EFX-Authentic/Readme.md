# Authentic  

#### *Fact check it with* -- **Authentic**

An idea :bulb: to collaboratively manage and restructure and restrict false information to improve the quality of online presence.

## Inspiration 🥇 

Significant changes in Digital communication has lead to the rise of false information in media and broadcast platforms. 

This has also lead to increase in including false articles for public besides complaints/demands to authorities. (e.g. road damage at Street-3.14, although no such street exists.)

The technological ease of copying, pasting, clicking and sharing content online has helped  proliferate FAKE news. False information in the form of complaint, stories or hoaxes created to deliberately misinform the authorities.

Usually, these stories are created to either influence people’s views, push a political agenda or cause confusion and can often be a profitable business for online publishers. 


## How can it help? ⛑️ 

Authentic helps the government to track and address false information by asking the citizens to classify the info and provide its associated details.
This allows concerned authorities to resolve incidents and contributes to urban economic growth and development.


It is based on the first Blockchain-based framework for the Future-of-Work.  thus, it can leverage all the potential of web3 applications.

- Workers can earn EFX 🪙 on the first Blockchain-based framework for the Future-of-Work.
- It provides access to a global, on-demand, 24x7 🕘 scalable WorkForce ⚙️.
- It can be run across various **devices** (like phones/pcs/tablets) as well as across **platforms** (like Android 📱 , Windows 🪟 , Mac 💻 , Linux :heart:).
- Unified development process for all devices.

## How we built it 🔧 

We built it using

- **Effect SDK:** The backbone of the entire app, everything else communicates and interacts to help achieve our goal.
- **HTML/CSS/JS:** For template making.
- **Node.js:** For interacting with the network via effect SDK.
- **Vue.js:** For providing a front end for the government/authorities to create batches and submit tasks.



## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting started with Web3, was very exciting and it's the best accomplishment that I am proud of 😃, although it was made easily accessible by Effect Force. Understanding the current information and broadcasting platforms plight and helping for its betterment is one of the things I am proud of



## What we learned
It was an awesome experience learning about Effect.ai and especially Effect Force as the #Future4Work.


## What's next for Authentic ⏭️

Other important features that I would enjoy adding are:

- Showing task summary instead of the entire results.
- Addition of Ad revenue for monetization.



Hope you enjoyed the project 😃.

A sincere thanks to Effect.AI and Devpost for creating an opportunity to learn through the Hackathon.

Have a beautiful day 😊.
