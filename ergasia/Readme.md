#### Project Description
It is a task distribution platform powered by Effect Network. It allows companies and individuals to upload tasks and get them done quickly. It currently has 5 campaigns which are Converting handwritten images to text, Editing Images, Technical Code Debug, Feedback for posters and asking Academic Course related questions. 

We ran into several challenges like uploading images from user to effect testnet and retrieving the results
and using ipfs to upload our user images. We learnt several things about the effect network SDK and the IPFS file system.

We intend the platform to serve users across a larger range including students, graduates, home makers & more.

Various freelancing platforms like Fiverr and Upwork are centralized and the task completion takes a long time. We wanted a decentralized platform to get tasks done quickly and no central authority taking their commission. ergasia is a task distribution platform powered by Effect Network. It allows companies and individuals to upload tasks and get them done quickly. It currently has 5 campaigns which are Converting handwritten images to text, Editing Images, Technical Code Debug, Feedback for posters and asking Academic Course related questions.

Our app is built on html, css, js, effect-sdk, & ipfs.

#### Next Steps 
The future scope of our project is really big. We can implement various other tasks on our platforms and the Handwritten text to image can be used for various things like extracting information from Doctor prescriptions, Driving Licenses and Other ID proofs
