#### Project Description
BlockSage tries to utilise the Effect Network to solve the Billion dollar challenge of Content Moderation and making the web a safe place, while creating more opportunities for Effect Workforce. With BlockSage focus is on helping companies leverage BlockSage for content moderation even if they don't have any Web3 expertise.

#### Summary
I was able to implement a simple API to allow social media companies to post content for moderation on Effect Network.
The API works in a centralised manner allowing anyone use it even with Web2.

The following components were built in the process:
1. GraphQL APIs using Hasura Engine (Hosted on Heroku)
2. Express Server for custom APIs (Hosted on Heroku)
3. A Portal using Angular (Not hosted anywhere yet)

#### Next Steps

1. Integrate more content platforms (beyond Youtube)
2. Better targeting options based on Demographics
3. Improve usability
4. Allow API users to determine the sample size and p-value for statastical significance
4. Reach out to content platform teams to get feedback
